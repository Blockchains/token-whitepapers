# Description

A shared repo of token projects and links to their whitepapers. Submit PRs to add new tokens whitepapers and update existing ones to whitepapers.csv

## Submission process

To submit a whitepaper, [create an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) and add your whitepaper info with this structure:  

```
symbol: GNT
name: Golem
url: https://golem.network/crowdfunding/Golemwhitepaper.pdf
```

If a project has multiple whitepapers, you can include them using this format:

```
symbol: GNT
name: Golem
url: http://golemwhitepaper.com/business.pdf, http://golemwhitepaper.com/technical.pdf, http://golemwhitepaper.com/marketplace.pdf
```

## Criteria
1. The URL should point directly to the official file on the project site if it exists
2. If multiple whitepaper versions exist, include all of them in quotations (see Submission process)
3. If the token symbol is already claimed by another project, add an underscore numerical tag (ex: gnt and gnt_1)


We want to make this a community resource and welcome all suggestions. Open an issue to discuss if you have an idea for a new criteria.
