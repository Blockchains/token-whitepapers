# Description

A shared repo of token projects and links to their whitepapers. Submit PRs to add new tokens whitepapers and update existing ones to whitepapers.csv

## Submission process

To submit a white paper, fork this repo and add your white paper info with this structure:  

```
{
  symbol: BLC,
  name: BlockchainToken,
  url: https://blockchain.network/whitepaper.pdf
}
```

If a project has multiple white papers, submit a request to add them all:
```
{
  symbol: BLC,
  name: BlockchainToken,
  url: [https:whitepaper.pdf, https:yellowpaper.pdf] 
}
```

## Criteria
1. The URL should point directly to the official file on the project site if it exists
2. If multiple versions of the whitepaper exist, add them in an array
3. If the token symbol is already claimed by another project, add an underscore numerical tag (ex: _1)

## Acceptable reasons for submission:
1. New project and white paper
2. An updated white paper
3. Correct a broken white paper link
4. Update the link to come from a more reputable source (e.g. official project site)
