A shared repo of token projects and links to their whitepapers. Submit PRs to add new tokens whitepapers and update existing ones to whitepapers.csv

## Submission process

To submit a white paper, fork this repo and add your white paper info with this structure:  

```

```

Which corresponds to SYMBOL,NAME,WHITEPAPER

If a project has multiple white papers, use quotations:

```
GNT,Golem,”http://golemwhitepaper.com/business.pdf,http://golemwhitepaper.com/technical.pdf,http://golemwhitepaper.com/marketplace.pdf”
```

## Criteria
1. The URL should point directly to the official file on the project site if it exists
2. If multiple whitepaper versions exist, include all of them in quotations (see Submission process)
3. If the token symbol is already claimed by another project, add an underscore numerical tag (ex: _1)


We want to make this a community resource and welcome all suggestions. Open an issue to discuss if you have an idea for a new criteria.
