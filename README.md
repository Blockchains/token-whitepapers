# Description

A shared repo of token projects and links to their whitepapers. Submit PRs to add new tokens whitepapers and update existing ones to whitepapers.csv

## Submission process

To submit a white paper, fork this repo and add your whitepaper info with this structure:  

```
{
  symbol: BLC,
  name: BlockchainToken,
  url: https://blockchain.network/whitepaper.pdf
}
```

If a project has multiple whitepapers, submit a request to add them all:
```
{
  symbol: BLC,
  name: BlockchainToken,
  url: [https:whitepaper.pdf, https:yellowpaper.pdf] 
}
```

## Criteria
1. The URL should point directly to the official file on the project site if it exists
2. If multiple versions of the whitepaper exist, add them in an array
3. If the token symbol already exists, add an underscore numerical tag (ex: _1)
